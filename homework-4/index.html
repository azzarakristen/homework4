                This sculpture can be found in the European Sculpture Wing of the Met. Whenever I go, I am inspired by the anatomical detail and accuracy of this sculpture. 
                Even when it is right before your eyes it is difficult to believe that it is made of marble. 
                The composition and facial expressions translate so much raw emotion.

                Vertigo Movie Poster
            </h2>

                - Saul Bass

            <p>
                This is a poster for the Hitchcock movie 'Vertigo' designed by Saul Bass. I like the simplicity of the color palette; 
                the red, black, and white work well together to match Hitchcock's energy. The thin linework and handwriting-inspired typeface 
                were also good design choices for this poster.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The movie Vertigo and the movie poster came out in 1958.</li>
                <li>Saul Bass designed many other movie posters for Hitchcock as well.</li>
                <li>There are many different versions of this poster, including a blue poster and a pink poster, but this seems to be the most common one.</li>
